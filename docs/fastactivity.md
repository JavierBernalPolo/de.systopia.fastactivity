CiviCRM Extension for high performance activity features


##**Current status**

Currently this extension implements a "FastActivity" tab which uses an entirely new BAO class (CRM_Fastactivity_BAO_Activity) to query the database. This is implemented in the "standard" CiviCRM format with a separate whereClause function which is not present in the original CRM_Activity_BAO_Activity class. This should allow for easy implementation of extended filtering in the future.


##**Features**

- A new filter is provided on the contact activities tab which uses a multi-select to allow filtering on multiple activity types.
- An add/remove filter is added on edit activity for "With Contact" when > 20 to allow editing this field on large records.
- A new filter is provided on the contact activities tab which uses a multi-select to allow filtering on campaigns and their sub-campaigns.


##**Not implemented**

- The activity search functions are not in the scope of this extension.


##**Requirements**

- Requires campaign extension (for campaigntree API) to search for activities of child campaigns in contact activity tab.
- Requires fontawesome extension for displaying icons (for various icons / engagement level): [[https://github.com/mattwire/uk.co.mjwconsult.fontawesome]]
